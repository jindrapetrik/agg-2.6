# Implementation Status - Flash Rasterizer Features

## User Request (Comment #3457648226)
Continue translation with:
1. Compound rasterizer for proper fill rendering  
2. Scanline renderer with anti-aliasing
3. Stroke rendering with line styles

## Completed ✅

### Scanline Renderer with Anti-Aliasing
**Files Created:**
- `PixFmtRgba.java` - RGBA pixel format with alpha blending
- `RendererScanlineAaSolid.java` - Solid color scanline renderer  
- `RenderingScanlines.java` - Rendering utility methods
- `CellAa.java` - Cell structure with Y coordinate

**Files Enhanced:**
- `RendererBase.java` - Integrated with pixel format
- `ScanlineU8.java` - Added span storage with coverage arrays
- `RasterizerScanlineAa.java` - Added sweepScanline() method
- `AggBasics.java` - Added calculateAlpha() for coverage conversion

**Status:** Core anti-aliasing infrastructure complete. Can render simple paths with proper alpha blending.

## In Progress ⚠️

### Compound Rasterizer for Fill Rendering

**What's Done:**
- Cell-based rasterization structure in place
- Y-coordinate tracking in cells
- Scanline sweep infrastructure
- Cell sorting (Y then X)

**What's Needed:**
The complete AGG cell rasterization algorithm is highly complex:
- **renderHLine()** - Needs full implementation for diagonal lines with subpixel accuracy
- **line()** method - Currently incomplete for non-axis-aligned lines
- Proper accumulation of coverage and area across cells

**Current Behavior:**
- Simple axis-aligned rectangles: Works partially
- Diagonal lines: Incomplete
- Complex Flash shapes: Hangs (incomplete diagonal handling)

**C++ Reference:** `agg_rasterizer_cells_aa.h` - The renderHLine method alone is ~100 lines with complex fixed-point math for subpixel-accurate Bresenham line drawing.

## Not Started ❌

### Stroke Rendering with Line Styles

**What Exists:**
- `ConvStroke.java` - Stub wrapper
- `VcgenStroke.java` - Property holders only
- Line style enums (LineCapE, LineJoinE, InnerJoinE)

**What's Needed:**
- Vertex generation for stroke outlines
- Join style calculations (miter, round, bevel)
- Cap style calculations (butt, round, square)
- Width offsetting with normal calculation
- Approximately 500+ lines of geometric calculations

**C++ Reference:** `agg_vcgen_stroke.h` - Complex vertex generator with state machine

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Cell Rasterizer Complexity
The C++ AGG uses:
- Fixed-point arithmetic (POLY_SUBPIXEL_SCALE = 256)
- Bresenham-style line drawing
- Careful accumulation of coverage and area
- Cell block management for memory efficiency

Current Java implementation has the structure but needs the detailed algorithm translation.

### 2. Stroke Generation Complexity  
Requires:
- Vector math for perpendicular offsets
- Geometric calculations for joins
- Arc generation for round caps/joins
- Self-intersection detection for very sharp miters

### 3. Compound Rasterizer
Needs working cell rasterizer first, then:
- Multi-style fill support
- Left/right fill tracking
- Style handler integration
- Span generator interface

## Recommendations

### Short Term (Can Complete Now)
1. ✅ Scanline rendering infrastructure - DONE
2. Simplify rasterizer to handle axis-aligned shapes first
3. Document the complex algorithms that need translation

### Medium Term (Significant Work)
1. Translate complete renderHLine from C++ (100+ lines)
2. Complete line() method diagonal handling
3. Test with progressively complex shapes

### Long Term (Full Feature Parity)
1. Implement VcgenStroke vertex generation
2. Add compound rasterizer multi-style support
3. Performance optimization

## Code Quality
- All code compiles ✅
- Basic structure follows AGG architecture ✅
- Anti-aliasing blending works correctly ✅  
- Simple paths generate some output ✅
- Complex paths need algorithm completion ⚠️

## Summary
The scanline renderer with anti-aliasing is complete and functional. The rasterizer foundation is in place but needs the core AGG cell rasterization algorithm fully translated (significant complexity). Stroke rendering needs vertex generation implementation (also significant complexity).
